# SIBI Hand Gesture Classifier

This project aims to recognize and classify SIBI (Indonesian Sign Language) hand gestures in real time using a Deep Neural Network and MediaPipe.
The model was trained using ~12,800 hand gesture images, providing more than 510 labeled samples for each alphabet letter to ensure high accuracy.

## Project Goals
This project aims to recognize Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) hand gestures in real-time using a webcam and classify them into alphabet letters to support inclusive communication.
